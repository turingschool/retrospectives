# Retrospective - June 30, 2015

## Plan

* 9:00 - Week-by-week staffing plans for the next two modules
* 10:00 - Organizing communication and meetings
* 11:00 - Student empowerment
* 12:00 - Lunch
* 1:00 - Prep work and post work
* 2:00 - Rethinking Spirals and Scope/Sequence across modules
* 3:00 - Lesson planning: what's working, what's not, and why?

### Grab Bag

In the fantasy land where we finish the above topics early, here are some others we might choose to cover:

* 1505 really struggled in Module 1. Why? Was it avoidable? How do we improve for 1507?
* How do we cut down on the first week dropouts? It seems that people don't take us seriously when we talk about the
work load / work week. How do we fix that?
