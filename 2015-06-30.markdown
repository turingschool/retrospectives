### Descriptions

#### Week-by-Week Staffing Plans

Let's build a matrix with each of the weeks for the next two modules matched with the four content areas, fill in the
known staff absences, fill in known visitors, and find the weak spots.

#### Organizing Communication and Meetings

We have a lot of communication happening. Can we get it more organized and rational? Some goal interactions:

* Operations team (Jorge, Raissa, Daisha, Marissa) - weekly
* Directors team (Jeff, Rachel, Steve, Jorge) - weekly
* Academic team (Rachel, Steve, Horace, Josh M, Mike, Jorge, Jeff) - weekly? biweekly?
* Jobs team (Jeff, Marissa) - weekly
* Operations 1-on-1s (Jorge with each of Raissa, Daisha, Marissa) - biweekly
* Academic 1-on-1s (Steve/Rachel with each of Horace, Josh M, Mike, Jorge, Jeff?) - twice per module?
* Jeff 1-on-1s (Jeff with each of Rachel, Steve, Horace, Josh M, Mike, Jorge, Raissa, Daisha, Marissa) - twice per module?

6 + 6 + 3 + 6 + 9 + 10 + 18 = 58 meetings ?!?

#### Student Empowerment

* There are over 100 alumni
* There are over 80 active students
* There are only 10 of us
* How do we put them to work to (a) increase student value and (b) lighten our load?

#### Prep Work and Post Work

* Discuss the Prag Studio plusses and minuses
* Review the Tealeaf Academy plan
* Review the current twice-weekly Q&A sessions
* Can we get tougher on prep work now that we have a waiting list?
* What could better prep mean for module 1?

Then, on the other side:

* The free-space problem after graduation
* Can post-work support the prep-work?
* What about continued async academic classes? JS Frameworks?
* What about a "policy" for sitting in on classes?

#### Rethinking Spirals and Scope/Sequence

#### Lesson Planning: What Works, What Doesn't, and Why?

### Grab Bag

In the fantasy land where we finish the above topics early, here are some others we might choose to cover:

* 1505 really struggled in Module 1. Why? Was it avoidable? How do we improve for 1507?
* How do we cut down on the first week dropouts? It seems that people don't take us seriously when we talk about the
work load / work week. How do we fix that?
