### Descriptions

#### Week-by-Week Staffing Plans

Let's build a matrix with each of the weeks for the next two modules matched with the four content areas, fill in the
known staff absences, fill in known visitors, and find the weak spots.

#### Organizing Communication and Meetings

We have a lot of communication happening. Can we get it more organized and rational? Some goal interactions:

* Operations team (Jorge, Raissa, Daisha, Marissa) - weekly
* Directors team (Jeff, Rachel, Steve, Jorge) - weekly
* Academic team (Rachel, Steve, Horace, Josh M, Mike, Jorge, Jeff) - weekly? biweekly?
* Jobs team (Jeff, Marissa) - weekly
* Operations 1-on-1s (Jorge with each of Raissa, Daisha, Marissa) - biweekly
* Academic 1-on-1s (Steve/Rachel with each of Horace, Josh M, Mike, Jorge, Jeff?) - twice per module?
* Jeff 1-on-1s (Jeff with each of Rachel, Steve, Horace, Josh M, Mike, Jorge, Raissa, Daisha, Marissa) - twice per module?

6 + 6 + 3 + 6 + 9 + 10 + 18 = 58 meetings ?!?

#### Student Empowerment

* There are over 100 alumni
* There are over 80 active students
* There are only 10 of us
* How do we put them to work to (a) increase student value and (b) lighten our load?

#### Prep Work and Post Work

* Discuss the Prag Studio plusses and minuses
* Review the Tealeaf Academy plan
* Review the current twice-weekly Q&A sessions
* Can we get tougher on prep work now that we have a waiting list?
* What could better prep mean for module 1?

Then, on the other side:

* The free-space problem after graduation
* Can post-work support the prep-work?
* What about continued async academic classes? JS Frameworks?
* What about a "policy" for sitting in on classes?

#### Rethinking Spirals and Scope/Sequence

* Critical look: are we spiraling or are we building incrementally?
* What are grads succeeding with, and where are they weak?
* Is there value in those weak skills?
* What are the high-level topics that should be persistent across multiple modules?
* What are the smaller topics that can be present in only one module?
* Are there any threads we can take out?
* Any threads obviously missing?
* Can we get serious about some high-level standards for each module?

#### Lesson Planning: What Works, What Doesn't, and Why?

* What lesson types are we currently using?
* What's the distribution? Is that right?
* For lesson types that are over-represented, why do we do things that way?
* For lesson types that are under-represented, why don't we do them more often?
* What does our planning cycle currently look like?
* What common weaknesses do we see in our lessons or planning?
* What's a realistic path towards more robust lesson development?

### Grab Bag

In the fantasy land where we finish the above topics early, here are some others we might choose to cover:

* 1505 really struggled in Module 1. Why? Was it avoidable? How do we improve for 1507?
* How do we cut down on the first week dropouts? It seems that people don't take us seriously when we talk about the
work load / work week. How do we fix that?
* After Rachel comes back from Nevada and Steve is back from paternity leave, what happens with 1511 and beyond? Can
we hit a work load / pace that feels long-run sustainable? What are our staffing needs/wants as we finish the year and
look towards 2016?
* How can we better target student recruitment to bring in the underrepresented people we want to see in the program?
